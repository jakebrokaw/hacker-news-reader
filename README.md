This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Hacker News Reader

This is a simple, React web app that displays all the newest Hacker News stories (from newest to oldest). It utilizes an infinite scroll feature (similar to a Facebook or Twitter feed), pulling in twenty stories at a time. The production build of this app _should_ allow it to work in offline mode. I'll be honest though, as I'm fairly new to React, I'm not sure if this is the case as I was only working with the app locally.

4. Run `npm start` and the app will open in a new tab in your browser.
